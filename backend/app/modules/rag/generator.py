"""
SIH26159 SecureMailScope — grounded generation with cite-or-refuse.

The model is given only the retrieved spans and is required to cite the
span_id supporting every sentence. After generation, each sentence is checked
against the retrieved text; a sentence that is not verifiable is removed, and
if nothing survives the answer is a refusal.

The verifier is deliberately conservative and mechanical rather than a second
LLM call: it can be tested, it cannot be talked into agreeing with itself, and
it cannot hallucinate. Support is confirmed by checking the sentence's content
words against the union of the cited spans.

All network egress in the product passes through here. Nothing is sent except
the question, the session id, and the retrieved spans, which are themselves
already in the repository or the uploaded capture.
