"""
SIH26159 SecureMailScope — Grounded RAG retrieval.

Retrieval is fully local and deterministic: BM25 over a static corpus of RFC
clause text, the scoring rubric, and the findings actually computed for the
session under analysis. Nothing is embedded and nothing is sent to a vector
service, so the analyst can reproduce a ranking by hand and every citation
resolves to a span that is in the repository or in the capture.

The generator (see ``generator.py``) only ever sees spans returned by this
module, which is what makes cite-or-refuse enforceable.
