"""
SIH26159 SecureMailScope — Ask (grounded RAG assistant, FR-39).

Three behaviours are guaranteed, in order of priority:

1. **Refusal outside scope.** Questions that are not about the capture or the
   analysis method are refused without calling the model.
2. **Refusal without evidence.** If retrieval finds nothing relevant, the
   request is refused rather than answered from general knowledge.
3. **Cite-or-refuse.** The model only ever sees retrieved spans, and every
   sentence it writes is verified against the span it cites. Unverifiable
   sentences are dropped; if none survive, the answer is a refusal.

Retrieval is local BM25 over RFC text, the scoring rubric, and the findings
computed for this capture. Generation is the single network call in the
product, and it receives only the question and the retrieved spans.
